# EDA-Data-Preprocessing-on-Google-App-Store-Rating-Dataset

Project Overview:
I am excited to share my recent project, "EDA & Data Preprocessing on Google App Store Rating Dataset," where I conducted a comprehensive analysis of app ratings from the Google Play Store. This project aimed to uncover valuable insights and prepare the dataset for further analysis, including machine learning applications

Key Objectives:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and patterns within the dataset. This included visualizing rating distributions, identifying outliers, and assessing correlations between variables.

Data Preprocessing: To ensure data quality and consistency, I applied various preprocessing techniques. This involved handling missing values, converting categorical variables into a suitable format, and normalizing numerical features.

Challenges and Solutions: Throughout the project, I encountered challenges such as dealing with missing data and transforming categorical variables. To address these issues, I employed data imputation methods and utilized one-hot encoding for categorical variables, ensuring the dataset's integrity.

Tools and Techniques Used:
I leveraged Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, seaborn, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization. Additionally, I applied machine learning techniques for data preprocessing tasks.

Impact:
The project's outcomes have contributed to a cleaner and more structured dataset, making it suitable for various data-driven tasks. This includes developing predictive models, recommendations, or further in-depth analysis of app ratings.Project Overview: I am excited to share my recent project, "EDA & Data Preprocessing on Google App Store Rating Dataset," where I conducted a comprehensive analysis of app ratings from the Google Play Store.
